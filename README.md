# Resurgence

**Status:** Experimental ðŸš§  
This repository contains the experimental foundation of _Resurgence_, a game
currently under development. It's an early-stage playground for prototyping
ideas, documenting experiments, and developing the core storyline.

## Whatâ€™s Here

- **Experiments**  
   Current work is structured around small, testable examples that can be run
  via [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). These are documented in
  [Experiments](./examples/experiments.md).

- **Storyline**  
  Narrative and world-building efforts are captured in [Story](./resurgence_story.md).

- **Playable Prototype**  
  A proof-of-concept version is occasionally published on [Itch.io](https://n8behavior.itch.io/resurgence).

## Note

This is currently a personal development space. While I'm sharing it with a few
collaborators, this is not yet a polished or public-facing project. Expect
broken things, shifting ideas, and half-built systems.
