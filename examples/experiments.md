Self-contained “mini-projects” to quickly validate core gameplay ideas and mechanics. Each should be small enough to tackle in a day or two, yet focused enough to teach something concrete about your game’s feel, UX, or tech feasibility.

**Approach**

1. Spin them up in isolation as examples in this project.
2. Gather quick metrics or feedback.
3. Iterate or pivot based on what we learn
4. Layer these mechanics together in a composite prototype.

- [ ] Procedural Terrain Slice

* **What:** Generate a small grid of height-map terrain (perlin or diamond-square) and render it in 2D top-down or 3D.
* **Why:** Test how ridge-lines, plateaus, and canyons look at playable scale. Tune noise parameters until you get strategic chokepoints.
* **Metric:** Percentage of maps with clear “defensible” features versus too flat or too chaotic.

---

- [ ] Strike-Radius Targeting UI

* **What:** Load a static map texture, overlay an adjustable circular crosshair. Allow mouse-drag to resize radius and preview impact area.
* **Why:** Nail down the interaction flow for “choose where to fire.” Make sure it’s precise but not fiddly.
* **Metric:** Time to set a target (seconds) and number of accidental mis-sized strikes in user tests.

---

- [ ] Growth-Type Overlay Demo

* **What:** Take a sample terrain image and procedurally paint “growth patches” in 3–5 colors (denoting species), with blending at edges.
* **Why:** Validate your color palette, saturation encoding, and legend/UI so players can intuitively read resource maps.
* **Metric:** Accuracy in “what type is this area?” quiz with play-testers.

---


- [ ] Simple Skirmish Encounter

* **What:** Place a player avatar and a handful of AI agents on a flat arena. Implement basic pathfinding (A\*), line-of-sight checks, and attack logic.
* **Why:** See if combat feels responsive, whether AI is challenging but not overwhelming, and how resource hits/registers look.
* **Metric:** Average fight duration and player hit-rate vs agent hit-rate.

---


- [ ] Resource Collection & Conversion

* **What:** Scatter “resource nodes” (rocks, growth pods) that can be clicked or collided with to harvest. Add a simple UI counter/inventory and a conversion step (“pod → material”).
* **Why:** Test whether the collection loop (find → collect → convert) is satisfying or too grindy.
* **Metric:** Number of clicks or key-presses per unit resource, and time to process 100 units.

---


- [ ] Panel-Storyboard Generator

* **What:** Create a mock “timeline” UI where you feed it a sequence of in-game events (e.g., first encounter, harvest, defeat) and it spits out placeholders for graphic panels.
* **Why:** Prototype how players pick moments for their “graphic novel” review. Validate UX: is picking and re-rolling intuitive?
* **Metric:** Successful panel selection rate and user satisfaction in a quick hallway test.

---


- [ ] Projectile Arc & Impact Markers

* **What:** Implement a ballistic projectile (gravity + drag) that the player can lo-click and drag to aim, showing a dotted trajectory and landing marker.
* **Why:** See if the physics-based aiming feels natural, and whether the arc visualization gives players the right feedback.
* **Metric:** Accuracy of first-shot landings vs target, and user ability to adjust arc mid-test.

---


- [ ] Rugged Terrain Pathfinding

* **What:** Take your terrain slice and overlay a simple grid graph. Run A\* to find a path between two points, penalizing steep slopes. Visualize the path.
* **Why:** Determine whether automated navigation (or enemy AI) can handle your map complexity, and how steepness weighting needs tuning.
* **Metric:** Path length vs optimal straight-line, and failure rate on extreme maps.

---


- [ ] Interactive Material Inspection

* **What:** Spawn a “discovered material” node that, when clicked, brings up a 3D inspect panel showing stats/description.
* **Why:** Prototype your inspection UI flow—does it break immersion? Is the info panel clear and actionable?
* **Metric:** Time to find a material, inspect it, and return to play, measured in seconds.

---


- [ ] HUD & Input Mapping

* **What:** Build a minimal UI overlay showing health, resource count, and current tool. Implement keyboard/mouse binding menus and live remapping.
* **Why:** Verify that your core HUD layout doesn’t obscure the world and that input customization works before you build more features.
* **Metric:** Percentage of first-time testers who can remap keys and read their status without a manual.
