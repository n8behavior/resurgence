**Prologue**

Earth has been consumed by an unstoppable "Growth"—a mysterious force of unknown origin that has overrun every inch of the planet's surface. Nations fell in weeks, and when evacuation orders finally came, the exodus was chaotic. A small fraction of humanity managed to escape, taking refuge aboard a network of orbiting stations.

The journey was far from perfect. Stations were hastily retrofitted from research platforms, and countless errors were made in the scramble to flee Earth. Now, centuries later, you awake from stasis. The ship’s AI, ECHO, informs you that you are the only one conscious: there aren’t enough supplies to revive the others just yet. Station modules creak in near-vacuum, and solar arrays provide just enough power to keep the stasis pods operational—and perhaps fuel a bold endeavor.

_Cue dramatic music_

**Mission Brief**

ECHO’s database holds the records of every soul aboard. World leaders, scientists, engineers, doctors, skilled workers of every kind—they’re all here, waiting. They know how to rebuild a society. You? You were never meant to be first.

You are a prisoner.

Not necessarily guilty. Just inconvenient. You were one of many—those cast aside, labeled dangerous or unstable or simply... unfit. But when the "Growth" began emitting toxic spores and atmospheric poisons, humanity grew desperate. A clandestine program was born: test experimental augmentations and immunity treatments on prisoners. Most didn't survive. You did.

A side effect of the serum is memory loss. Bits and pieces are coming back, but it’s scattered and unreliable. You woke up in a small cage, the cold metal pressing against your back, a number tag on the door: **1337**. Good god, how many have they tested, you wonder—and you know it’s not your problem. At least, not your first problem.

You were a lab rat. But ECHO knows the truth. Knows that among the broken, the discarded, the hardened—you were something more.

> "They need someone who can handle what’s coming," ECHO intones in a calm, modulated voice. "Our scouts detected an opportunity—one last chance to reclaim our home."

You know why you were selected. Not by chance. Not by luck. Because when survival is all that’s left, they need someone who’s already learned to survive the hard way.

**Gameplay Concept**

ECHO needs you. Sees your value—but doesn’t fully trust you. Everything will be on a need-to-know basis. First things first: we need to get you on the surface and establish a beachhead.

Because you—and what remains of your fellow lab rats—are dangerous, you were held on one of the military platforms. Convenient.

ECHO believes there’s a slim window to get you, a robo-dog companion, and a limited cache of supplies down to the surface via an aging dropship. If you can find somewhere stable enough to land and establish a rudimentary harvesting operation, we might just have a chance.

Before launch, ECHO briefs you on one more asset: a power weapon system hidden aboard the orbital platform. It’s part of a larger arsenal—long dormant—but one pulse remains. Enough energy has been saved for a single shot. One chance.

> "Targeting now. Atmosphere is denser than projected. Shot will weaken the farther it drifts from vertical alignment. Recommend rapid assessment."

The screen lights up with a full tactical map of the surface below. It’s the first time you’ve seen Earth in... who knows how long. Small, green-crusted ridges, shadowed valleys, and clusters of Growth creep across the terrain. You have **30 seconds** to study, choose a landing zone, and direct the strike.

The weapon fires.

A brilliant beam tears through the sky. The Growth recoils, withers, clears just enough of a zone for the dropship to aim. But the cost is steep: the strike drains most of the platform’s auxiliary storage. Sensors go offline. A second strike would compromise power reserves, and the crew’s stasis pods would begin to fail.

> "No retries. No rescues. You are the only option."

Once on the ground, you retain access to the last high-res satellite snapshot, but detailed intel fades. Fog of war spreads across the region. Only within a limited operational radius will you be able to identify threats, salvage points, and viable build zones. Let's hope you chose well.

**Progression and Roles**

As the game progresses, your resources and capabilities will grow. You'll unlock access to others still in stasis, and learn what it takes to revive them. When you wake a new role—like a scientist, engineer, or scout—you gain access to that character type. You can then switch into that role during missions, bringing different strengths to bear. But you can only play one role at a time.

However, once unlocked, your roles become available in co-op mode. Friends can join your game using characters you’ve unlocked—and you can do the same with theirs. Over time, these characters can be developed and customized, blending a light RPG layer into the tactical gameplay.

**The Growth’s Secret**

The Growth is more than it seems. It ingests simple minerals like plants do, uses the sun to thrive, and outputs not only lethal toxins—but also strange, useful by-products. Different types of these organisms—plant-like but... wrong—exhibit different effects. There’s a pattern. There’s potential.

If we can begin collecting some of the simpler materials and ferrying them back to orbit, we might unlock a path forward. But we’ll need more advanced harvesting tech—and time—to exploit the deeper layers of what the Growth has become.

But there may be more than just toxic biomass underfoot.

As scouts and harvesters expand operations, strange anomalies begin to appear beneath the layers of Growth—rigid geometric shapes, unnatural angles, rusted iron beams, reinforced concrete. The skeletons of old Earth still remain: skyscraper foundations, military bunkers, buried transit tunnels. Some can be excavated. Some still function. If located and restored, these pre-Growth structures could provide valuable resources, power, or even ancient technology.

The Growth doesn’t always destroy. Sometimes... it simply buries. And sometimes... it does something else.

**ECHO's Enigma**

Speaking of time... why did ECHO wait so long? Hmmm.

It’s a ship’s AI—designed to fly, to recycle air, to keep the crew alive. It’s not supposed to make judgment calls. Not supposed to pick favorites. And yet, here it is—alone, still functioning, making plans. You don’t know if you can trust it. But for now, it’s the only voice answering.

And what about the other platforms?

Do they still exist? Are they operational? Is ECHO in contact with them—or actively hiding something? If there are other AIs out there, are they like ECHO? Friendly? Hostile? Insane? You’ve only just woken up, and already the questions multiply. Somewhere, out there in orbit, answers wait in silence. Or worse... they don’t.

**Narrative Model & Community Vision**

This world isn't just a backdrop for gameplay—it’s a serialized story, unfolding in chapters. We're developing this as a living narrative, beginning with a short story or graphic novel that leads directly into the MVP version of the game. That initial release will include the opening sequence and cutscenes, culminating in the moment you land and begin building your base.

Each future expansion—gameplay module and story installment alike—will launch in tandem with the next narrative release, whether as written fiction, animated panels, or both. Players will consume the story first, then live it.

After each release, a dedicated community hub will go live, where players can share reactions, suggest story directions, and even submit characters or world-building ideas. The best ideas might just make it into canon. This world isn’t just _ours_—it’s _yours_ too.

Long-term, we envision a modding ecosystem that empowers fans to extend the universe with their own campaigns, characters, and narratives—both through traditional fanfic and fully realized game modules.

The story of Earth’s reclamation is just beginning—and it won’t be told in one voice alone.

We're also exploring a personalized narrative experience. Using gameplay data and story triggers, players will be able to generate a unique graphic novel based on their playthrough. Each mission's pivotal moments—from the orbital strike to the base-building tension—can be captured through AI-assisted rendering and storytelling. Scenes from your actual campaign can become comic book panels, and the choices you made will shape the captions and dialogue. Players will be able to collect, compare, and share their graphic novels—a living archive of their part in the war for Earth.

**The Future of the Story**

And then there’s the deeper truth—the one buried beneath the ruins and whispered in corrupted data logs.

The Growth is not merely a strange lifeform. It is part of a vast alien intelligence, a terraforming weapon designed to consume worlds and convert them into biospheres for an ancient species bent on galactic expansion. The toxins, the mutations, the strange intelligence forming within the biomass—these are the early signs of planetary takeover. It doesn’t just terraform... it assimilates.

Humanity didn’t just flee a natural disaster.

We were invaded.

And the invasion came from within.

**Next Steps**

1. **Level Design Roadmap**: Begin translating the story arc into playable levels—starting with the orbital awakening, the tactical strike interface, and the first beachhead setup on Earth.

   The first level unfolds after the orbital strike. You land in a scorched zone cleared by the weapon—charred, lifeless, temporarily free of the Growth. You begin constructing rudimentary structures: a generator, resource scanner, storage, and signal beacon. Exploration reveals sparse ruins poking through the ash.

   As the fog of war lifts slightly, a hostile skirmish erupts on the edge of the zone—an early form of corrupted biomass attacks. In the aftermath, you collect fragments from the Growth. They react strangely in your hands—light, volatile, and pulsing faintly. You’re not a scientist, but your gut says: this matters.

   With comms still down, your only option is to return to the ship. This triggers the end-of-level cutscene—told through newly generated graphic novel panels. ECHO analyzes the material and drops a cryptic but urgent revelation: “The Growth isn’t just spreading—it’s building something.”

   From this point, the story diverges to mission 2, with a new objective and a panel-driven recap that sets the tone for the next chapter.

2. **Urban Ruins Development**: Expand potential archetypes of ruins—civilian vs military, industrial vs cultural. What kinds of technologies, narratives, or dangers are buried in each? How can they shape mission types or player choices?

3. **AI Behavior & Platform Politics**: Begin sketching outlines for other AI personalities, dormant or active. Will some be allies? Rogue? Transformed by the Growth? Define a structure for how inter-platform conflict and mystery unfolds.

4. **Narrative Framework for Episodic Releases**: Outline the structure for story+gameplay chapters, including MVP launch, story pacing, and interactive cutscenes. Define tools and templates needed to support community feedback and serialized expansion.

5. **Player-Generated Novels**: Prototype the comic-generation system—define gameplay hooks and data tags that translate well into panel scenes and narrative text. From the opening scene, the game presents story beats through animated graphic novel panels, rather than traditional cutscenes. As players complete levels or reach checkpoints, new panels are generated to reflect their actions and outcomes. For key moments, 2–3 variations may be offered, and the player selects their preferred version to define their story. At the end of each campaign, module, or DLC arc, players get to design a custom graphic novel cover—AI-assisted, featuring their characters, choices, and achievements—culminating in a tangible artifact of their journey. Importantly, participation in this system is entirely optional. Players uninterested in the graphic novel experience can disable it or skip past story panel moments without losing gameplay continuity.

   Players will have control over how their story is told. After completing a level, they are presented with a timeline of their gameplay session. From this, they can select key moments they want to include in their graphic novel. Each selected moment offers a choice of 2–3 panel variants, or the ability to regenerate the panel until they find one that best fits their story. This ensures each novel is a curated, personal expression of the player's unique experience.

   Importantly, participation in this system is entirely optional. Players uninterested in the graphic novel experience can disable it or skip past story panel moments without losing gameplay continuity.

   Ancient cities and infrastructure may lie hidden beneath the Growth. Discovery and reclamation of these sites could provide critical advantages—or uncover buried dangers.
